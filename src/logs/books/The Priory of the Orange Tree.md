## pre-reading thoughts

i’ve heard great things about this book so i’m excited to dive into it, only with a bit of apprehension because i *just* finished a really long fantasy book and this one takes two months to read (with 7 chapters a week as per the schedule above…). but hopefully reading a romance novel in between as a palate cleanser will help? doubt.jpg

regardless, i won’t strictly hold myself to follow the schedule to a tee, but more like a guideline of some sort.

### review

*Stopped at 69%.* (Nice?)

This book was really long ðŸ˜­ Maybe it was bad luck and bad timing because Iâ€™m also reading another [epically long book](/logs/books/the-monster-baru-cormorant) and I only had time and attention for one. Really, itâ€™s my fault for trying to multitask (multiread?) two long books at the same time.

My one gripe though is that it took 60% of the way through for something interesting to happen. Thatâ€™s 300 pages out of 544 ðŸ’€

I might give this another try another time but right nowâ€¦ Itâ€™s a DNF for me.

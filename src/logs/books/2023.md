<p>I bought a new Kobo this year and got a library card when I moved out. Evidently I made good use of both because I
  bumped up <a href="/logs/books/2022/">last year's</a> record of 5 books to 17 books read this year!</p>

## log

  {% for book in books23 %}
  {% include "partials/book.liquid" %}
  {% endfor %}

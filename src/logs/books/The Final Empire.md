### review

Revised my rating from 5 to 4 stars when I re-read this because while it has a great story, the fight scenes are soooo confusing and disorienting that I usually just end up skimming it (like the first time I read it). I appreciate the details on how the action scenes go but also, it's almost akin to reading a sex scene and trying to visualize their current position, lmao.

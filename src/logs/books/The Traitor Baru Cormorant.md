### review

> Baru saw in the city what she felt in herself. The two-faced allegiances, the fearful monitoring of self and surroundings, the whimpering need to please somehow kneeling alongside marrow-deep defiance. One eye set on a future of glittering wealthy subservience, the other turned to a receding and irretrievable freedom.

**Update:** 4/5

I've been thinking about this book lately and I feel like the {% spoiler %}downer ending{% endspoiler%} actually fits the character. I don't necessarily like it and I would enjoy a {% spoiler %}happy ending{% endspoiler %} more, but if it did happen, it would not make sense for the  character and her motivations. And with this first installment of a  trilogy, it just means that her character arc isn't done yet {% spoiler %}(and maybe she would get her happy ending in the end, but I don't know that yet). (<- delusional???){% endspoiler %}

I still really like it though, because it's rare to find a book that has  Game of Thrones-esque political drama with a lesbian protagonist (I  don't enjoy GoT but that is the closest comparison I can give). I love  the protagonist, I love that she is so ambitious with her one-track  mind; it ends up hurting people that she loves but she is so  laser-focused and committed to her goal in the long run that she would  do it again if she had to. And so I really appreciate that about her  character.

It still is a slog at some parts, I will admit. This  book took me the longest to read in 2022--not that I've read a lot of  books that year for that statistic to be significant, but I digress. It  is a \*long\* book. Nevertheless, I changed my mind and I'm willing  to continue on to the trilogy and see if it gets any better for Baru  Cormorant (it probably doesn't).

~~3.5/5~~

~~good  prose, okay story, love the "romance" and the machiavellian protag, but  the ending... the final battle was a slog, and the twist was somehow  unsatisfying. like a twist for the sake of a twist. i know baru is  playing the longest con here but i don't have the patience to see it  through, sorry.~~

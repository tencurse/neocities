### review

This is one of many books where I've watched the movie adaptation  first before reading the book. To be fair, I've heard of this book way  before *The Handmaiden* but I never really got around to reading  it. And even when the movie came out, I still didn't read it until I  watched a YouTube video criticizing the movie and its stark difference  with the book.

This is not *The Handmaiden*. I'll try not  to compare the two, because it's been years since I last watched the  movie, and it was with scuffed English subtitles because I was just so  excited to watch the movie that I couldn't wait for proper subtitles to  come out--and then I didn't watch it again after that.

ANYWAYS.

So, upon reading this book, I already have a vague idea of all the twists  and turns this book is going to take me. Even with that, it was still a  very enjoyable ride. And if you've watched the movie, you already know  this shit is gonna be real good. It has a bit of a slow start for sure,  but that was because I was *itching* for Sue to meet Maud already. I gotta say, I loved Maud's POV more than Sue, only because I related to her character more.

The biggest gripe I had with the story was the third act. Since I read this book with the knowledge of the movie's ending, I had thought it was  going to be similar. It was not. It was very, very different and I  wouldn't say it was terrible, but it *did* slog. The third act  focuses more on the mothers of the two main characters because it's  integral to another twist (that wasn't in the movie), and while yes, it  is a mind-blowing twist, I just did not care enough about the mothers to want to read about them. I'm like, *Who cares? I want Sue and Maud to get back together already!* But that's just me.

I think it's also difficult for me to review this book objectively  because I have prior knowledge of the movie, and I really love the  movie. It's not something that I can just "forget" so I can read the  book with an objective lens. It is always going to be there, and whether I like it or not, it will definitely affect my opinion on the book.

Overall, the book and the movie are two different things, and while I loved the  movie's take on the ending more, I would not necessarily discount the  book. Because the book is genuinely enjoyable to read. I'm a sucker for  sapphic romance and yearning, what else can I say?

Here's a few quotes that I liked:

> That is all she does; but I see it, and my heart gives a plunge—that caving, or dropping, that has so much panic in it, so much darkness, I supposed it fear, or madness. I watch her turn and stretch, walk her random way  about the room—see her make all the careless unstudied gestures I have  marked so covetously, so long. Is this desire? How queer that I, of  all people, should not know! But I thought desire smaller, neater; I  supposed it bound to its own organs as taste is bound to the mouth,  vision to the eye. This feeling haunts and inhabits me, like a sickness. It covers me, like skin.

> Everything, I say to myself, is changed. I think I was dead, before. Now she has  touched the life of me, the quick of me; she has put back my flesh and  opened me up. Everything is changed.

### review

> You think you’ve wormed inside me—planted seeds or spores in my brain—whatever vegetal metaphor suits your fancy. But here I’ve repaid your letter with my own. Now we have a correspondence. Which, if your superiors discover it, will start a chain of questions I anticipate you’ll find uncomfortable. Who’s infecting whom? We know from our hoarse Trojans, in my time. Will you respond, establishing complicity, continuing our self-destructive paper trail, just to get in the last word? Will you cut off, leaving my note to spin its fractal math inside you?

This entire book is so beautiful and well-written. The pacing is great and I was never bored at any point reading it. The love story is \*sooo\* good. I’m always a sucker for enemies/rivals-to-lovers and then them confessing to each other and then fighting against all odds for their love and then you remember time isn’t linear at all, but a circle, and  even \*then\*, love transcends that shit.

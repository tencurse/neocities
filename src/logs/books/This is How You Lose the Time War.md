### review

> “And then we’d be at each other’s throats even more.” Oh, petal. You say that like it’s a bad thing.

This entire book is so beautiful and well-written. The pacing is great and I was never bored at any point reading it. The love story is *sooo* good. I’m always a sucker for enemies/rivals-to-lovers and then them confessing to each other and then fighting against all odds for their love and then you remember time isn’t linear at all, but a circle, and  even *then*, love transcends that shit.

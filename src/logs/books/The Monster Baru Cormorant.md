### review

I liked this way more than the first book. I liked reading about Baru grappling with {% spoiler %}her grief{% endspoiler %} and justifying the terrible things she does in the name of {% spoiler %}her dead lover{% endspoiler %}. Because what is {% spoiler %}Hu's sacrifice{% endspoiler %} worth if Baru fails? So, Baru has to do it. She has to. (No, she doesn't.)

I love the way Baru lives in her own head for most of the time that she forgets--and learns--that connections to other people are important. That these connections are real and tangible; it can give and kill life, it can start and end wars.

AND I LOVE TAU-INDI! AND TAIN SHIR! I loved reading their perspectives of the story, most especially the ending. Holy fuck. I think I would like to read an entire book with just Tain Shir as the protagonist.

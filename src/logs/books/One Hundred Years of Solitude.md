### review

*Stopped at 34%.*

I tried. I really really really tried to  like this book. I started reading this to participate in r/bookclub for  January since I was either not interested in the monthly pick or I had  already read them. So, I picked this.

At first, it was charming. A little bit confusing with the names sometimes, so I had to pay a little more attention to it. But coming from a Filipino background, it wasn't  really that confusing to me. The "magical realism" of it was really  great, and having it contained to the small town of Macondo was really  interesting to me.

However. At one point, there just wasn't  enough of the magical realism that I liked for me to finish this book.  At one point, there were more icks that I just did not like. This is  probably a matter of taste, I guess, and from a literary point of view,  perhaps it is intentional to show how messed up the Buendia family is. I think I would have appreciated that stuff a little more if there were  actual consequences to their actions rather than just it being "that  happened" and then moving on.

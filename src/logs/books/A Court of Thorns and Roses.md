### review

*Stopped at 50%.*

I read it to see what the hype was all about. Not my type of book. Also I didn't really get any sort of chemistry from the two leads and I thought the protagonist was kind of annoying. (Who the heck said this was an enemy-to-lovers type of story ðŸ˜­) {% spoiler %}Yeah, I know the enemy-to-lovers part doesn't come until like the second book or whatever.{% endspoiler %}

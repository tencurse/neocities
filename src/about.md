my name’s ten (yeah, like the number). i write code for a living, write fiction for fun, and have way too many side projects for someone with limited free time.

[this site’s](/site-info) my personal corner of the internet — a space where i can code without having to be “professional,” whatever the hell that means. [making websites](/resources/dev) should be fun and deeply unserious.

i started messing around with html and css by editing tumblr themes sometime in the early 2010s, which eventually turned into full-blown website brainrot in april 2023 after falling into the small web rabbit hole... and then never looked back.

## interests

- tragic women in sci-fi & fantasy

- hoarding cool websites and then never bookmarking them properly

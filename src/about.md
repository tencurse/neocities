hello! i’m ten. i’m a software developer by day (professionally) and fiction writer by night (un-professionally... hobby-ly?).

i made this site to exercise my coding and design skills (mostly my design skills), and also as a way to offer a piece of myself out into the world wide web. making websites are cool, my friend.

if you’d like to chat, hit me up at 10kph@proton.me or at any of my socials below :-)

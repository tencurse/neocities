my name’s ten (yeah, like the number). i’m a software developer by day (professionally) and fiction writer by night (un-professionally... hobby-ly???). i was born and raised in manila, philippines, and i’m now living in bc, canada.

i made [this site](/site-info) to exercise my coding and design skills, and where i can code things for fun and not have to worry about being “professional” online, whatever the hell that means. [making websites](/resources/dev) is fun and cool, my friend.

my journey in becoming a webmaster started when i tinkered around tumblr themes and my own themes some ~10 years ago... but i didn’t actually make my _own_ website until may 2023 when i found about the small web. and now here we are! yayyy

check out my [media log](/logs), [shrines](/shrines) and [uses](/uses) (wip) page!

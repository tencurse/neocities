      <h2>the indomitable</h2>
      <section class="size-m outline scroll">
        In Forgotten Realms lore, fiend warlock powers are an avenue to corruption, commonly used to serve the dark
        interests of their patron; in this case, it’s Mizora who is a constant influence to him for the seven years
        since he’s been pacted.
        <p>
          However, Wyll not only fights against becoming evil but he also uses his powers for good. He makes the
          conscious choice to help and protect people, usually at the expense of himself. For seven years, he’s
          struggled with that possibility of corruption from Mizora always looming over him, whilst also dealing with
          the grief of losing his family and the only life he’s ever known. At the young age of seventeen.</p>
        <p>
          Despite it all, he resists and defies his fate. He soldiers on, doing good and helping people using the
          warlock powers that damned him and his soul.</p>

        WYLL — How’s it feel to be back [in the city]?
        <p>DARK URGE — I don’t remember it. But I’m afraid of who might remember me.</p>
        <p>WYLL — No one knows better than I do the deep shadows haunting Baldur’s Gate. But I also know you can find
          light if you know where to look. And this I promise: you can always look to me.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="scroll" style="z-index: 11;">
        Okay the thing is that it would have been SO easy for Wyll to turn to the dark side, as it were. When he was
        exiled he had nothing but a blade and a demon in his ear. He knows he did the right thing and was punished for
        it, and then he was set loose. The fact that Wyll spent seven years with a devil as his patron and only
        consistent companion and still remained good is a testament to his determination, grit, and strength of
        character, not dullness of it

        I always really love how Wyll is so steadfast with his moral compass and principles. No matter how much he
        loves you, he can and will leave you if you go too far, because his duty to defend the people always comes
        first.
        <p>I also think about how he learned that from his father. How that lesson was driven in when he signed a
          warlock pact with a devil at 17 and his father banished him for it.</p>
        <p>No doubt Wyll knows his father loves him, but he also believes his father was right to banish him. And though
          Wyll took that lesson to heart, his exile didn’t turn him jaded or bitter. He’s still the same Wyll who loves
          love songs and heroic stories. He has so much love to give and it shows!</p>
        <p>It shows in the way he still believes in second chances and will wholeheartedly support you if he knows
          you’re willing to help yourself. He doesn’t doubt that you can strive to be good and do good. He’ll be there
          for you every step of the way.
        </p>
        <p>Even so, Wyll is not naive. If you go too far in doing evil, he won’t hesitate to strike you down even if it
          kills you. You are not more important than the safety of the people. He will not damn the world for you. And I
          think that’s beautiful!!!</p>

          <p>And he has been corrupted both in body and spirit, and his story is about resisting this change instead of
            succumbing to it. At his core the corruption can’t reach him in significant way even when his body is
            changed against his consent. I do love the way he can reach people especially traumatized people because of
            his own trauma and show them a different way or hold space for them to reach more ethical conclusions.</p>

        At the start of the game, Wyll has an oathbound mission to hunt down a devil named Karlach. Little does he
        know, he’s been misled by his fiend patron Mizora. Karlach is not a devil, but an innocent tiefling caught in
        Zariel’s Blood War. She escaped Avernus to pursue her freedom.
        <p>Thanks to the tadpole connecting Wyll’s and Karlach’s consciousness, Wyll realizes the trap Mizora had laid
          down before him. And for most likely the first time in his life, Wyll stays his blade and spares Karlach,
          breaking Mizora’s orders to hunt down an innocent person.</p>
        <p>As punishment for saving a life, for <em>doing the right thing</em>, Mizora transforms Wyll into a
          devil. In an instant, Wyll’s body is dragged through the layers of Hell and emerges with a set of horns
          and ridged skin.</p>
        <p>The physical change causes him distress, rightfully so, with the tiefling refugees no longer seeing him as
          the heroic Blade of Frontiers, but a devil. Wyll fears he may never redeem himself and earn back the trust of
          the people he wants to protect.</p>

        Wyll insists that it’s <em>his</em> choice to make the pact and to leave the city. Because owning it as his
        choice means he
        can rationalize some sort of control over it. Acknowledging it as anything else would mean that he was forced
        into it. That it’s not actually his fault. That it’s Mizora’s fault—which he does acknowledge—but more
        importantly that his father did him wrong. And that idea just Does Not Compute. So. Rather than realizing and
        accepting that his father is human and made mistakes and hurt him, Wyll would rather just take all the blame
        and make it his choice.
        <p>Being on the road constantly fighting battles meant he probably never had to sit down and think about the
          Implications of what happened to him. Add the fact that he literally could not speak the truth for seven whole
          years. He had to fill in the gaps. More and more rationalizing to make it make sense to others and to himself.

        The tragedy of Wyll and Ulder isn’t that Ulder is some irredeemable monster. It’s that every parent is
        flawed, and Ulder has made so many concessions in his life to protect Baldur’s Gate, do what is good for
        Baldur’s Gate, that while Wyll was doing everything in his life for his father, and his father alone—Ulder
        was still doing everything for this city he’s devoted his life to. Because he believes in this broken system
        and his broken ass corrupt Flaming Fist more than he believes in his own son’s innocence.
        <p>Wyll believes in fairy tales because his father believes in fairy tales and he loved his father, his father
          was
          his world, and even at 24, he’s not ready to admit his father was wrong or made mistakes. Even when he says
          people like his father—politicians—are always making mistakes, lol.</p>
        <p>They were close. And his father loves him. And that makes what Mizora did all the more evil and despicable.
          Ulder may have given up his son—but he also lost him.</p>
        <p>Could you forgive yourself if you lost a child that was so good, and sweet, and loved you as much as Wyll
          loved
          Ulder?</p>
        <p>Mizora tricked them both. She knew what she was doing. She was isolating him. On purpose. That’s what
          abusers do!!! They make you rely on them. They take away all the good people and good things in your life
          until you’re left with nothing.</p>
        <p>Ulder was flawed. But he gave Wyll fairy tales, and he let him have fairy tales.</p>
        <p>And everything, everything, everything, that Wyll loves about himself came from his father!!!</p>

          Wyll’s greatest fear is to not be wanted or not be needed. Because he’s such a protector of the

          I think the biggest disservice bg3 fans do to Wyll is by making him out to be the ‘normal’ guy. He’s easily
          the most unhinged person there. He’s like ‘look, Father! Would a catastrophic disappointment do THIS?’ And
          gets one of his limbs turned into a giant tentacle or smth to save a box of kittens. Exposed to Mizora and
          didn’t become a misogynist. I heard him say ‘huzzah’. I want to study him.
